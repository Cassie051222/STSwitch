can you see this .ps1, the main focu I want you to look at is the patch version controller logic, how I insert an patch number and it fills the other words as a wildcard, I want you to create an app that I can choose which patch I want to switch to, then you take the logic from the code I provided, number 11, so when I insert a patch number it looks in my install folder for that certain patch number I gave, then it copies the C.ISystems Folder. deletes the current one in proigram files (x86) and then pastes the one it just copied from my patch, then it should register the dlls as the logic in number 11, use pyqt6 and make the new code in @switch.py , make a good but simple UXUI and also make it futureproof for any other version that might to come
